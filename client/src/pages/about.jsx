              "Totally Random Thoughts" is a blog by Ken Staples that serves as
              a gateway to the extraordinary, where the mundane meets the
              mysterious. It's a place where the past, present, and future

              lines between reality and the unknown blur. So, if you're eager to
              explore the edges of possibility and beyond, "Totally Random
              Thoughts" is your compass to the curious.

              A devoted fan of authors Robert L. Forward, John Gribbin, Brian
              Greene and Alvin Toffler, his passion for science fiction and
              non-fiction knows no bounds. His interests are not limited to
              literature, as he is deeply fascinated by astronomy, astrophysics,
              and the vast unknown. Ken’s curiosity doesn’t stop there; it
              extends to meteorology, paleontology, and the dynamic realm of
              technology, where he takes pleasure in computer programming.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2017, Ken found a new dimension of peace and purpose when he
              embraced his faith and was baptized as a Roman Catholic. Ken’s
              fascination extends to the rich tapestry of biblical history and
              its profound influence on modern civilization. He holds the
              conviction that science and religion are not mutually exclusive
              but rather complementary forces. This belief in the harmonious
              coexistence of science and religion is a testament to Ken’s
              multifaceted approach to exploring the unknown and the mysterious
              through the blog. <br />
              <br />
              Ken’s thirst for adventure doesn’t end there; he is an avid
              explorer of the unknown, delving into the mysteries of ghosts,
              Sasquatch, aliens, and other paranormal phenomena. Inspired by the
              legendary explorer Josh Gates, Ken’s explorations fuel the diverse
              and intriguing content of “Totally Random Thoughts,” making it a
              hub for those who seek to understand the unexplained.
